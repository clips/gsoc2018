# De-escalation Twitter Bot
#### Aim: This project aims to explore the topics of context-free generation, topic and sentiment analysis, paraphrasing and the use of principles of non-violent communication for de-escalation of online discourse. Powered by Python machine learning backend and a Twitter bot written in Node.js (using [Seed](https://github.com/nodebox/seed "Seed GitHub Repo") for seeded context-free generation), this bot will try to participate in heated Twitter threads and resolve conflicts. 

#### Collaborators: Alexander Rossa, Frederik De Bleser

### Seed:
Seed is a JavaScript application (also available as a Node.js module - [SeedText](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seedtext)) used for seeded pseudo-random procedural content generation. It uses its own microlanguage for guiding the generation and the whole documentation for this can be seen in [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/nodebox/seed "Seed GitHub Repo").
